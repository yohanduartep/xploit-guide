### Completionist Strategy

This strategy is the fourth step of XPloiT where testers play the game collecting every possible outcome.

```
"This strategy helps testers focus on collecting game outputs such as achievements, items, rewards, scores, and upgrades.
In this strategy, the tester tries to collect every possible output from the game, following the longest path to do so."
```

### Objectives

- Find and collect every output from the game.
    - Does the game have achievements, items, rewards, badges, or a score system?
    - Are there missable items or rewards?
    - Are there hidden items, areas, rewards or achievements?
    - Have you searched for any secrets (e.g., objectives, interactions, areas)?
    - Have you searched for any Easter eggs in the game?
    - Are there badges, titles, or additional rewards for fully completing the game or specific sections?
- Explore the paths.
    - Among the available paths, which one is furthest from the starting point?
    - Which path is the longest or most demanding in terms of time?
    - Which path is the longest or most demanding in terms of effort?
    - Have you completed the game by following the longest possible route to collect all outputs?
    - Are there any tasks, quests, or side missions that you have not completed yet?
- Interact with every NPC.
    - Does the game have enemies?
    - Does the game have interactions with characters (NPCs)?
    - Do defeating enemies or interacting with NPCs unlock additional rewards or paths?

### Examples

Here, the tester explores the longest path (blue arrow) to reach the objective, defeating every enemy (red circles) and collecting all items along the way (pink circles). Additionally, the tester considers exploring the map (cyan arrow) to search for possible secrets (piece of content within the game that can be missed by the player).
