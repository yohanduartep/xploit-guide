### Noob Journey Strategy

This strategy is the third step of XPloiT where testers play the game ignoring all tips and guidance.

```
"This strategy helps xplore unused or less common paths
and features, by ignoring the game’s tips and requirements and explore alternative paths to reach the objectives."
```

### Objectives

- Collect, explore and interact with the remaining.
    - Which outputs were not yet collected?
    - Which paths were not yet explored?
    - Which NPCs were not yet interacted with?
- Collect, explore and interact ignoring the tips.
    - Does the game offer any tips or guidance for collecting outputs?
    - Does the game offer any tips or guidance for paths?
    - Does the game offer any tips or guidance to NPCs?

### Examples

<<<<<<< HEAD
Here, the tester focuses on reaching the objective by avoiding the expected path (blue arrow) and attempts to reach it through alternative methods without meeting the usual requirements (cyan arrow). Game tips and guides are disregarded.
