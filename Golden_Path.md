### Golden Path Strategy

This strategy is the second step of XPloiT where testers play the game as intended by the designers.

```
"This strategy is set as the second step of XPloiT to help testers play the game as intended by the designers.
In this strategy, testers play the game as intended by the designers and keep their actions straightforward.
They follow the main or default path in the game test segment, avoiding deviations.
Testers may briefly stop to investigate features of particular interest."
```

    - Which outputs are essential to progression?
    - Which path is essential to progression?
    - Which interactions with NPCs (both friendly and hostile) are essential to progression?
- Collect, explore and interact with the effortless.
    - Which outputs are less demanding to collect in terms of effort?
    - Which path is shorter or less demanding in terms of effort?
    - Which interactions with NPCs (both friendly and enemies) are less demanding in terms of effort?
- Collect, explore and interact as the designers supposedly want.
    - Which outputs, in your opinion, were intended by the designer to be collected?
    - Which path, in your opinion, was intended by the designer to be followed?
    - Which NPCs (both friendly and enemies), in your opinion, were intended by the designer to be interacted with?

### Examples

Here, the main character (1) needs to reach the objective (4). By using the \textit{Golden Path Strategy}, the tester focuses on proceeding directly to the objective without spending much time on items (3) or enemies (2) along the way (blue arrow). However, the tester may briefly stop to investigate features of particular interest (cyan arrow).
