### Overtime Strategy

This strategy is the sixth step of XPloiT where testers should address questions and notes from previous steps.

```
"In this strategy, testers address all the questions or possible test cases they have noted and perform random tests whenever they think of something new to explore."
```

### Objectives

- Answer your questions.
    - Do you have any questions that haven't been answered related to outputs?
    - Do you have any questions that haven't been answered related to paths?
    - Do you have any questions that haven't been answered related to NPCs?
    - Do you have any questions that haven't been answered related to UI?
- Extra thoughts.
    - Do you have any ideas or notes that you haven't tested yet?
    - Have you had any random idea that you want to test?
    - Do you think you could test more in any strategy but did not have the time?

### Examples

- A question about a specific NPC's behavior that wasn't fully explored in previous strategies. Interact with that NPC in various ways to see if any new behaviors or dialogues emerge.
- A note made about a hidden path in the game. Explore that area more thoroughly to see if can uncover anything new in this strategy.
