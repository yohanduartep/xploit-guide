### Speedrun Strategy

This strategy is the fifth step of XPloiT where testers play the game aiming to reach a specific goal as quickly as possible, often by bypassing standard gameplay elements.

```
"This strategy helps testers try different paths and discover possible exploits.
Testers learn about the paths and objectives of the game test segment, set new objectives, and attempt to reach them using the shortest available path.
They aim to achieve goals quickly by ignoring requirements or attempting alternate paths."
```

### Objectives

- Use the game objective.
    - Are any of the collectibles necessary to beat the game goal or objective?
    - Are there any obtainable requirements to beat the game goal or objective?
    - Among the available paths, which is the fastest to reach the game goal?
    - Which path is shorter to reach the game goal?
    - Are there any tasks or quests required to unlock paths?
    - Are there any paths necessary to beat the game that are locked?
    - Is it possible to beat the game without defeating enemies (or defeating the smallest possible number)?
    - Does the game require obligatory interactions with NPCs?
    - Do defeating enemies or interacting with NPCs unlock additional rewards or paths?
- Define a speedrun objective X that is not the current game objective.
    - Are any of the collectibles necessary to beat your goal or objective?
    - Are there any obtainable requirements to beat your goal or objective?
    - Among the available paths, which is the fastest to reach your goal?
    - Which path is shorter to reach your goal?
    - Are there any tasks or quests required to unlock paths to your goal?
    - Are there any paths necessary to beat your that are locked?
    - Is it possible to beat your goal without defeating enemies (or defeating the smallest possible number)?
    - Does your goal require obligatory interactions with NPCs?

### Examples

Here, the tester considers whether there is a faster path to reach the objective (blue arrow). They might explore climbing platforms, bypassing via a shortcut (cyan arrow), or exploiting potential bugs to quickly reach the objective.

A faster path to the objective (blue arrow), where the tester could benefit from the character's spawn to avoid reaching the lower platform. The cyan arrow represents a possible even faster path, eliminating the need for an additional jump. This could lead to the discovery of new bugs.
